        "    - ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) refers to a framework in AI that emphasizes the interplay between reasoning (deliberation) and action in decision-making. In this context, an AI agent doesn't just act blindly based on pre-programmed instructions but can reason about different possible actions and outcomes. The agent's decisions are influenced by both immediate information and longer-term planning.\n",

Find out more facts and trivia about Gujarat's history, geography, culture, and economy. Gujarat is a state of India located on the country's western coast on the Arabian Sea. It encompasses the entire Kathiawar Peninsula as well as the surrounding area on the mainland. The coastline of Gujarat is 992 miles (1,596 km) long, and no part of the state is more than 100 miles (160 km) from the sea. Its capital is Gandhinagar. The capital of Gujarat was changed from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar for several reasons. Firstly, Ahmedabad was considered too crowded and congested for a modern administrative center. Secondly, Gandhinagar is centrally located and provides easy access to all parts of the state. Gandhinagar, the current capital of Gujarat, took over the reins from Ahmedabad in 1970. Situated on the west bank of the Sabarmati River, Gandhinagar is a planned city, meticulously designed to provide an ideal administrative center. It is renowned for its wide roads, well-maintained infrastructure, and serene ambiance. ... Gujarat is a state with diverse culture, history and geography.
