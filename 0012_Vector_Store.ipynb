    "# What is a Vector Store?\n",
    "- A vector store is a system or tool used to store and search vector embeddings.\n",
    "- Embeddings are numerical representations of data (like text, images, audio, etc.) that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, \"king\" and \"queen\" are close in meaning, so their vectors will be close in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - So a vector store:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Stores these vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Allows fast similarity search (like: “Find me texts similar to this one”)."

    "# Why Use a Vector Store?\n",
    "We use vector stores for tasks where semantic search or machine learning is involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Semantic search: Find related documents even if the words don't match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): In AI apps like ChatGPT + your documents, you retrieve relevant context from a vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Recommendations: Suggest items based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Clustering & classification of data based on meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Traditional keyword search can’t understand meaning — vector stores can."
